Preface
=========================

Hi!

This book about RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is designed for software developers, especially those working with C++, who want to master resource management techniques that improve code safety and reliability. 

Whether you are a beginner seeking a solid introduction or an intermediate programmer looking to deepen your understanding, this book explains RAII clearly, from its core principles and history to practical examples and advanced usage patterns. 

You'll learn how RAII helps prevent resource leaks and ensures exception safety by using constructors and destructors to manage resources automatically. 

The book also discusses common idioms, benefits, pitfalls, and applicability in other programming languages to provide a well-rounded perspective. 

With concrete examples and hands-on explanations, this guide equips you to write more robust, maintainable, and efficient code using RAII principles.

It's an essential read for C++ programmers wanting to harness the power of modern, idiomatic resource management to boost code correctness and reduce bugs related to resource handling.

I'd love to hear from you if you have any questions or feedback as you read through it!
